# Cellular-Automata-ScreenSaver-SFML

C++ implementation cellular automata with graphical presentation using SFML library. The program provides some control, press F1 to see information. It can be used as primitive screensaver, just change extension of .exe file to .scr then install it.

About CA simulation. Program uses classical rules: 2-3 neighbors means live, birthrate is exact three neighbors. Long simulation can be boring so i added some randomness what means a chance of 1/1000 that live cell will be placed in place of dead cell.
